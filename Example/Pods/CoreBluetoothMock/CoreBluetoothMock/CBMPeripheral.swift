/// The `CBMPeripheral` class represents remote peripheral devices that your app discovers with a
/// central manager (an instance of ``CBMCentralManager``). Peripherals use universally unique identifiers
/// (UUIDs), represented by `NSUUID` objects, to identify themselves. Peripherals may contain one or more
/// services or provide useful information about their connected signal strength.
///
/// You use this class to discover, explore, and interact with the services available on a remote peripheral that
/// supports Bluetooth low energy. A service encapsulates the way part of the device behaves. For example, one
/// service of a heart rate monitor may be to expose heart rate data from a sensor. Services themselves contain
/// of characteristics or included services (references to other services). Characteristics provide further details about
/// a peripheral’s service. For example, the heart rate service may contain multiple characteristics. One characteristic
/// could describe the intended body location of the device’s heart rate sensor, and another characteristic could transmit
/// the heart rate measurement data. Finally, characteristics contain any number of descriptors that provide more
/// information about the characteristic’s value, such as a human-readable description and a way to format the value.
