The *Core Bluetooth Mock* library was designed to emulate *Core Bluetooth* objects, providing easy way to test 
Bluetooth-enabled apps. As the native Bluetooth API is not supported on a simulator, using this library you can run, test 
and take screenshots of such apps without the need of a physical phone or tablet. You may also start working on the
iOS app when your peripheral is still under development.

### Core Bluetooth?

The [Core Bluetooth](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corebluetooth) framework provides the classes needed 
for your apps to communicate with Bluetooth-equipped low energy (LE) wireless technology. It requires an iPhone or iPad to 
work making Bluetooth-enabled apps difficult to test. As the documentation states:

> Don’t subclass any of the classes of the Core Bluetooth framework. Overriding these classes isn’t supported and results in 
   undefined behavior.

### Core Bluetooth Mock!

The *Core Bluetooth Mock* library defines number of **CBM...** classes and constants, that wrap or imitate the corresponding
**CB...** counterparts from *Core Bluetooth* framework. For example, `CBMCentralManager` has the same API and 
behavior as `CBCentralManager`, etc. On physical iDevices all calls to `CBMCentralManager` and `CBMPeripheral` are
forwarded to their native equivalents, but on a simulator a user defined mock implementation is used. 

## How to start

The *Core Bluetooth Mock* library is available only in Swift, and compatible with iOS 11.0+[^1], macOS 10.13+, tvOS 11.0+[^1] and watchOS 4.0+,
with some features available only on newer platforms.
For projects running Objective-C we recommend https://github.com/Rightpoint/RZBluetooth library.

[^1]: Xcode 14 dropped support for iOS 9.0 and tvOS 9.0 in simulator. Now the minimum supported version is 11.0 for both platforms.

### Including the library

The library support [CocoaPods](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods), [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) and 
[Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager).

#### CocoaPods

- Create/Update your **Podfile** with the following contents

    ```ruby
    target 'YourAppTargetName' do
        pod 'CoreBluetoothMock'
    end
    ```

- Install dependencies

    ```bash
    pod install
    ```

- Open the newly created `.xcworkspace`

#### Carthage

- Create a new **Cartfile** in your project's root with the following contents

    ```
    github "https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-CoreBluetooth-Mock" ~> x.y // Replace x.y with your required version
    ```
    
- Build with carthage

    ```bash
    carthage update --platform iOS // also supported are tvOS, watchOS and macOS
    ```

- Copy the **CoreBluetoothMock.framework** from *Carthage/Build* to your project and follow [instructions from Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage).

#### Swift Package Manager

The library can also be included as SPM package. Simply add it in Xcode: *File -> Swift Packages -> Add package dependency*, 
type *https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-CoreBluetooth-Mock.git* and set required version, branch or commit.

If you have *Swift.package* file, include the following dependency:
```swift
dependencies: [
    // [...]
    .package(name: "CoreBluetoothMock", 
             url: "https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-CoreBluetooth-Mock.git", 
             .upToNextMajor(from: "x.y")) // Replace x.y with your required version
]
```
and add it to your target:
```swift
targets: [
    // [...]
    .target(
        name: "<Your target name>",
        dependencies: ["CoreBluetoothMock"]),
]
```

### Documentation

The documentation of the library is available [here](https://nordicsemiconductor.github.io/IOS-CoreBluetooth-Mock/documentation/corebluetoothmock).

### Migration from *CoreBluetooth*

Migration example is available [here](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-CoreBluetooth-Mock-Example).
See [Pull Request #1](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/IOS-CoreBluetooth-Mock-Example/pull/1) for 
step-by-step guide.

> **Note**
>
> The migration example application currently does not use mocks in tests. 
For that, check out the **Example** folder in this repository with *nRF Blinky* app, which is
using mock peripherals in Unit Tests and UI Tests. See below.

## Sample application: nRF Blinky

nRF Blinky is an example app targeted towards newcomer BLE developers, and also demonstrating the use 
of *Core Bluetooth Mock* library. This application controls an LED on an
[nRF5DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits)
and receive notifications whenever the button on the kit is pressed and released.

The mock implementation is used in Unit tests and UI tests. 
See [AppDelegate.swift](Example/nRFBlinky/AppDelegate.swift) where the mock environment is set up and
and [UITests.swift](Example/Tests) and [UITests.swift](Example/UI%20Tests/UITests.swift) classes.

The mock peripherals are defined in [MockPeripherals.swift](Example/nRFBlinky/MockPeripherals.swift).

## Nordic LED and Button Service

A simplified proprietary service by Nordic Semiconductor, containing two characteristics one to control LED3 and Button1:
- Service UUID: **`00001523-1212-EFDE-1523-785FEABCD123`**
  - First characteristic controls the LED state (On/Off).
    - UUID: **`00001525-1212-EFDE-1523-785FEABCD123`**
    - Value: **`1`** => LED On
    - Value: **`0`** => LED Off
  - Second characteristic notifies central of the button state on change (Pressed/Released).
    - UUID: **`00001524-1212-EFDE-1523-785FEABCD123`**
    - Value: **`1`** => Button Pressed
    - Value: **`0`** => Button Released
  
  For full specification, check out 
  [documentation](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/sdk_nrf5_v17.0.2/ble_sdk_app_blinky.html?cp=8_1_4_2_2_3).

## Requirements:
- An iOS device with BLE capabilities, or a simulator (to run the mock).
- A [Development Kit](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Software-and-Tools/Development-Kits) (unless testing mock).
- The Blinky example firmware to flash on the Development Kit. For your convenience, we have bundled two firmwares in this project under the Firmwares directory.
- To get the latest firmwares and check the source code, you may go directly to our [Developers website](http://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF5_SDK/) and download the SDK version you need, then you can find the source code and hex files to the blinky demo in the directory `/examples/ble_peripheral/ble_app_blinky/`
- The LBS (LED Button Service) is also supported in nRF Connect SDK: [here](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/samples/bluetooth/peripheral_lbs/README.html).
-  More information about the nRFBlinky example firmware can be found in the [documentation](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/topic/sdk_nrf5_v17.0.2/ble_sdk_app_blinky.html?cp=8_1_4_2_2_3).

## Installation and usage:
- Prepare your Development kit.
  - Plug in the Development Kit to your computer via USB.
  - Power On the Development Kit.
  - The Development Kit will now appear as a Mass storage device.
  - Drag (or copy/paste) the appropriate HEX file onto that new device.
  - The Development Kit LEDs will flash and it will disconnect and reconnect.
  - The Development Kit is now ready and flashed with the nRFBlinky example firmware.

- Start Xcode and run build the project against your target iOS Device (**Note:** BLE is not available in the iOS simulator, so the iOS device is a requirement to test with real hardware).
  - Launch the **nRF Blinky** app on your iOS device.
  - The app will start scanning for nearby peripherals.
  - Select the **Nordic_Blinky** peripheral that appears on screen (**Note:** if the peripheral does not show up, ensure that it's powered on and functional).
  - Your iOS device will now connect to the peripheral and state is displayed on the screen.
  - Changing the value of the Toggle switch will turn LED 3 on or off.
  - Pressing Button 1 on the Development Kit will show the button state as Pressed on the app.
  - Releasing Button 1 will show the state as Released on the App.
