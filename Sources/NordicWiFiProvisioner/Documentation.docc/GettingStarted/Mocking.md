# Getting Started with Mocks

Find out how to use the `MockManager` class to test your app without a real device.

## Overview

`NordicWiFiProvisioner` uses `CoreBluetooth` to communicate with the nRF-7 Series device. iOS simulators don't support Bluetooth, so you have to test your app on a real device. However, you can use `MockManager` to start developing your app without a real device.
